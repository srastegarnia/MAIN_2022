**"Introduction to brain decoding & encoding in fMRI"**

This `jupyter book` presents an introduction to `brain decoding` & `encoding` using `fMRI`. It was developed within the [educational courses](https://main-educational.github.io), conducted as part of the [Montreal AI and Neuroscience (MAIN) conference](https://www.main2022.org/) in November 2022.

Building upon the prior sections of the [educational courses](https://main-educational.github.io), the here presented resources aim to provide an overview of how `decoding` & `encoding` `models` can be applied to `fMRI` data in order to investigate `brain function`. Importantly, the respective methods cannot only be utilized to analyze data from `biological agents` (e.g. `humans`, `non-human primates`, etc.) but also `artificial neural networks`, as well as presenting the opportunity to compare processing in both. They are thus core approaches that are prominently used at the intersection of `neuroscience` and `AI`.

To test the consistency of representations in artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the brain, it is possible to **encode** brain activity based on ANN presented with similar stimuli, or **decode** brain activity by predicting the expected ANN activity and corresponding annotation of cognitive states.

``` 

The tutorials make heavy use of [nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/index.html) concerning 
manipulating and processing `fMRI` data, as well as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) to apply `decoding` & `encoding` `models` on the data.

We used the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) framework to provide all materials in an open, structured and interactive manner. ALl pages and section you see here are built from `markdown` files or `jupyter notebooks`, allowing you to read through the materials and/or run them, locally or in the cloud. The three symbols on the top right allow to enable full screen mode, link to the underlying [GitHub repository](https://github.com/main-educational/brain_encoding_decoding) and allow you to download the respective sections as a `pdf` or `jupyter notebook` respectively. Some sections will additionally have a little rocket in that row which will allow you to interactively rerun certain parts via cloud computing (please see the [Binder](#Binder) section for more information).


## Brain decoding vs. encoding

In short, `encoding` and `decoding` entail contrary operations that can yet be utilized in a complementary manner. `Encoding models` applied to `brain data`, e.g. `fMRI`, aim to predict `brain responses`/`activity` based on `annotations` or `features` of the `stimuli` perceived by the `participant`. These can be obtained from a multitude of options, including `artificial neural networks` which would allow to relate their `processing` of the `stimuli` to that of `biological agents`, ie `brains`. 
`Decoding models` on the other hand comprise `models` with which we aim to `estimate`/`predict` what a `participant` is `perceiving` or `doing` based on `recordings` of `brain responses`/`activity`, e.g. `fMRI`.

`Encoding` and `decoding` present contrary, yet complementary operations. While the former targets the prediction of `brain activity`/`responses` based on stimulus percepts/features (e.g. vision & audition), cognitive states or behavior, the latter aims to predict those aspects based on `brain activity`/`responses`.

## Setup

There are two ways to run the tutorials: `local installation` and using free cloud computing provided by [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). As noted below, we strongly recommend the `local installation`, as the `Binder` option comes with limited computational resources, as well as the missed possibility to directly further explore the `approaches` presented in this tutorial on your own machine. 


````{tab-set}
```{tab-item}  Local installation (Recommended)

For the `local installation` to work, you need two things: the fitting `python environment` and the `content`. Concerning `python`, please have a look at the hint below.

:::{admonition} Install python
:class: tip
:name: python-install-tip
You need to have access to a terminal with Python 3.
If you have setup your environment based on instructions of [MAIN educational installation guide](https://main-educational.github.io/installation.html), you are good to go ðŸŽ‰

If it not already the case,
[here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#how-to-check-your-python-version-on-windows)
is a quick guide to install python 3 on any OS.
:::

After making sure you have a working `python installation`, you need to get the `content` that is going to presented during the tutorial. In more detail, this is done via interactive `jupyter notebooks` which you can obtain by following the steps below:

1. Clone/download this repository to your machine and navigate to the directory.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/main-educational/brain_encoding_decoding.git
    cd brain_encoding_decoding
    ```

2. We encourage you to use a `virtual environment` for this tutorial
    (and for all your projects, that's a good practice).
    To do this, run the following commands in your terminal, it will create the
    `environment` in a folder named `env_tuto`:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env_tuto
    ```
    Then the following `command` will `activate` the `environment`:

    ```bash
    source env_tuto/bin/activate
    ```

    Finally, you can install the required `libraries`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r binder/requirements.txt
    ```

3. Navigate to the `content` of the `jupyter book`:
    ```bash
    cd content/
    ```

    Now that you are all set, you can run the notebooks with the command:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Click on the `.md` files. They will be rendered as jupyter notebooks ðŸŽ‰


```

```{tab-item} Cloud computing with Binder
If you wish to run the tutorial in `Binder`, click on the rocket icon ðŸš€ in the top right of a given `notebook` to launch it on `Binder`.

:::{warning}
The computing resource on `Binder` is limited.
Some cells might not execute correctly, or the data download will not be completed.
For the full experience, we recommend using the local set up instruction.

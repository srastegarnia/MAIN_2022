	abstract = "Understanding information processing in the visual system requires an understanding of the interplay among the system's computational goals and representations, and their physical implementation in the brain.Recent results indicate a consistent topology of functional representations relative to each other and anatomical landmarks in high-level visual cortex.The consistent topology of functional representations reveals that axes of representational spaces are physically implemented as axes in cortical space.Anatomical constraints might determine the topology of functional representations in the brain, which would explain the correspondence between representational and anatomical axes in the ventral temporal cortex (VTC).Superimposition and topology generate predictable spatial convergences and divergences among functional representations, which in turn enable information integration and parallel processing, respectively.Superimposition and topological organization in the VTC generates a series of nested functional representations, the arrangements of which generate a spatial hierarchy of category information.The spatial scale of functional representations may be tied to the level of category abstractness in which more abstract information is represented in larger spatial scales across the VTC.",

  abstract = "The functional architecture of the object vision pathway in the
              human brain was investigated using functional magnetic resonance
              imaging to measure patterns of response in ventral temporal
              cortex while subjects viewed faces, cats, five categories of
              man-made objects, and nonsense pictures. A distinct pattern of
              response was found for each stimulus category. The
              distinctiveness of the response to a given category was not due
              simply to the regions that responded maximally to that category,
              because the category being viewed also could be identified on the
              basis of the pattern of response when those regions were excluded
              from the analysis. Patterns of response that discriminated among
              all categories were found even within cortical regions that
              responded maximally to only one category. These results indicate
              that the representations of faces and objects in ventral temporal
              cortex are widely distributed and overlapping.",
